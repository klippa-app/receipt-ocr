### How Klippa Receipt OCR Works:

- Image Upload: You first need to upload the image of the receipt you want to process.
- Data Extraction: Klippa uses machine learning models and image processing techniques to analyze the image, identify key data points, and extract relevant information.
- Data Formatting: The extracted data is then formatted into a structured format (like JSON), which can easily be consumed by applications or compared with other datasets.
- Response: The service returns the structured data to your application, allowing you to process it as needed.
